# UE5-Car-control-rig
This a control rig for the epic car with a different bone hierarchy. It uses Fullbody IK to mimic suspension. However it breaks drift control, which is why i seperated them with an 'Enable IK' boolean control.

I built this with the help of this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMdlzHW32Oc .
However my rig uses a different amount of bones and controls

Built with UE5.1
